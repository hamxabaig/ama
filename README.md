Hey there, I'm Hamza Baig, a fullstack JS software engineer. I started my career from hacking :warning: and then slowly moved towards development side. I like to automate stuff. (It got to a point that i was no longer productive :joy:)

**Func Fact**: You maybe wondering why i have an 'x' in my github name or everywhere i signup. It was due to the fact that there were many 'Hamza' on the internet, so i changed my name a little bit for SEO purposes to make it unique back in 2012 when i started blogging :satisfied:
